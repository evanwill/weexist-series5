The lack of African Americans in public service stemmed from the pushback by white citizens to African Americans joining such services. The results of the pushback are eye-opening.

The school’s directive was to “offer advantages to young men and young women who desire to make preparation for teaching in the public schools of the State.” (https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1088&context=archives_catalogs).
